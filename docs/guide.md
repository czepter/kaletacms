# Kaleta guide

For whoever runs the site: from installation through the page builder to connecting AI.
[Česká verze](prirucka.md)

## 1. Installation and first steps

1. Upload the files to hosting (PHP 8.4+, MySQL 8 / MariaDB 10.6+), create an empty database and open `/install.php`.
2. In the form, choose a **starter site**: *Business website*, *Crafts and services* or *Consulting and agency*. Each brings
   its own style and Home, About us, Services and Contact pages built from ready-made sections with sample texts.
3. Choose **what you want switched on**: News, Forms and enquiries, Newsletter, Statistics, Redirects, language versions,
   the AI assistant… Extensions can be switched on and off at any time in the admin (**Extensions**); switching off deletes nothing.
4. The installation also creates a hidden draft **Privacy policy** page in the site language, linked from the footer, the cookie bar and the form consent. Fill in the details in square brackets and publish it.
5. After logging in, **First steps** on the **Dashboard** guide you through: site appearance, company details, pages,
   the privacy policy and email.

The admin is at `/admin.php`. Roles: an **administrator** can do everything, an **editor** manages content, a **news
author** writes their own news and may publish only with the publishing permission. In **Users → Roles** you can create
**custom roles** – a named set of sections (for example “Sales” with Enquiries only); changing a role updates all its members.

## 2. Page builder

Open the builder from **Pages → Builder** (or the “Edit here” link on the site). The middle is the **canvas – the real
page**, on the left the **Add / Structure** panel, on the right the properties of the selected element.

- **Adding:** click an element or a ready-made section in the Add panel, or **drag it onto the canvas** – a blue line shows
  where it will land (a frame means inside a container). Hover over a ready-made section to see its preview.
- **Moving:** the selected element has a ⠿ handle on the canvas – drag it elsewhere. You can also drag in the Structure.
  On tablets and phones tap **Move** (four arrows) and then the place where the element belongs.
- **Text:** double-click a heading or text to edit it right on the canvas; longer edits in the **Content** panel.
- **Style:** the **Style** panel – layout, size, spacing, typography, background. At the top, switch **Desktop / Tablet /
  Mobile**: a value for a smaller screen overrides the larger one only there. The **Hover** and **Press** toggles set the look
  on mouse hover (and keyboard focus) and when pressed – separately for tablet and mobile too. A **typography style**
  (Section heading, Lead…) sets the font in one choice; compose a shadow or border with the pencil ✎ next to the field.
  Grids have a **grid editor**: columns, rows and named areas. **Copy style / Paste style** moves the look to another element.
- **Classes:** in the **Advanced** tab, give an element a class (e.g. `karta`). A class style applies to every element with
  that class across the site – ideal for a repeated look.
- **Shortcuts:** Ctrl+Z undo, Ctrl+Shift+Z redo, Ctrl+D duplicate, Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V copy and paste (even between pages),
  Delete removes, Esc selects the parent element, **?** opens help – where you can also start the **editor tour**.
- **Preview:** next to the device switch choose a **wide monitor (1920 px)** or zoom 50–100 %.
- **Display conditions** (Advanced): show an element only between two dates (a promo banner) or only to visitors or signed-in users.
- **Saving and publishing:** changes save continuously as a **draft** – visitors see the published version until you
  press **Publish**. **Discard changes** restores the published version; **Versions** lists the last 20 publications.
  **Share** creates a link to the draft for a colleague or client: it opens without signing in, is valid for 1–7 days and is not indexed by search engines.
  If someone else edits the page meanwhile, the editor offers to load the newer version or overwrite it. Before publishing,
  a **check** flags buttons without links, images without descriptions, a missing main heading and low text contrast.
- **More elements:** icon, photo gallery with a viewer, tabs, accordion, carousel, map (loads only after a click),
  pop-up window (opened by a button linking to `#window-anchor`, on its own after a delay, after scrolling or on exit),
  breadcrumbs, **counter**, **progress bars**, star **rating**, **countdown**, **social networks**, **search**,
  **back-to-top button** and **newsletter sign-up**. Sections support a **background video**, videos a **poster**,
  navigation a **mega menu** and background images **parallax**.

A page that used to be plain text is converted by the builder automatically. You can switch it back to text in the page settings.

**Pages** have their own search-engine title, sharing image and a noindex option (page settings → Search engines and
sharing). A deleted page goes to the **trash** and can be restored for 30 days; **Duplicate** creates a hidden copy including the build.

## 3. Site appearance

**Appearance → Site appearance** changes the whole site at once. Two words, used the same way everywhere: a **starter
site** is sample content plus a style (you choose it at installation), and a **style** is a ready set of colours, fonts,
sizes and corner radius. Kaleta has no PHP themes since 1.6 – the look comes only from Site appearance, shared classes and
the builder.

The page has tabs:

- **Style** – pick a style in one click, then fine-tune it in the other tabs. The style your site is using is marked
  *current*. For a look built from your brand, ask Claude – it saves colours and fonts to the design system.
- **Colours** – primary, secondary, text, background, surface. Shades are derived automatically. The **Readability** block
  checks WCAG contrast; change any pair marked in red.
- **Dark mode** – off (always light), matching the visitor's device, or always dark – with its own text, background and surface
  colours. A **switcher for visitors** adds a light / dark / match-device choice to the header next to the languages; the
  choice is remembered in the visitor's browser.
- **Fonts and sizes** – heading and text fonts (also your own WOFF2 files), base font on phones and monitors, heading ratio,
  content width, and the **typography styles** (Main title, Section heading, Lead…) you pick for elements in the builder.
- **Shapes** – corner radius for buttons, cards, images and form fields.
- **Logo and icon**.
- **Import and export** – download and load the look in the W3C Design Tokens format (DTCG) for Figma or Tokens Studio.

On the right is a live preview of the home page (desktop / phone). Nothing is saved until you press Save.

**The draft look.** A change of the design system, of a shared class or of a menu does not reach visitors at once: it goes
to one **draft look** – from Site appearance, the builder, the menu editor and Claude alike. While there is one, every
admin screen shows a bar with what it changes and three buttons:

- **Preview the whole site** – a signed link that shows the site with the draft look and with the drafts of all pages and
  site parts, for you or a colleague (valid for a day). A bar at the top of the preview ends it.
- **Publish the look** – everything at once. The look before is kept under **Site appearance → Import and export →
  Earlier looks** (the last 20); **Back to this look** loads it into the draft again.
- **Discard** – the published look stays.

A brand-new shared class applies at once – it changes nothing that is already published, and new pages need it.

## 4. Site parts: header, footer, wrappers, pop-ups

**Appearance → Site parts.** Until you publish a part from the builder, its built-in default design is shown.

- **Start from a template:** four headers (logo left and menu right, centred logo, with a contact bar, minimal), four
  footers (columns, compact, with the imprint, with a call to action) and plain or extended wrappers. A template is a
  clean skeleton – colours, fonts and spacing come from your design system. It goes into the part's draft, so the site
  changes only when you publish it; check it on the whole site with **Preview the whole site**.

- **Header and footer** appear on every page. The **Logo**, **Navigation** (hidden behind a button on phones) and
  **Company details** elements fill themselves.
- **Wrappers** (news item, news list, 404 page) add sections around content the system assembles. The **Page content**
  element marks where the system inserts it.
- **Variants:** for the header and footer, choose **Add variant**, name it and tick the pages. The variant applies only
  there. An empty variant hides the part – handy for a landing page.

**Appearance → Menu** builds the main menu and the footer menu: pages, custom links, news and groups, with one submenu
level under each item. Reorder by dragging or with the arrows. Until you save it, the menu is built from pages “in navigation”.

**Appearance → Pop-ups** are windows over the page – a newsletter sign-up, a download for an e-mail, an announcement
bar, a discount or an event. Start from a ready-made template, build the content in the builder and publish it; then set
in **Settings** when and where it shows and turn it on.

- **Type:** a window in the middle, a slide-in panel in the corner, a bar at the top or bottom, or full screen.
- **Trigger:** after a number of seconds, after scrolling part of the page, when the visitor is about to leave, after
  seconds without activity, after a number of pages in the visit – or only by a link or button to `#popup-<address>`
  (that link opens the pop-up at any time).
- **Where:** the whole site, or selected pages, collection item pages and news; a language version, a period, phones
  or computers only, visitors from a campaign (`utm_*`) or from a given site.
- **Frequency:** once per visit, once every N days, until the visitor closes it or sends the form in it, or every time.
  The visitor’s browser remembers it – no cookies.
- **Results:** views, closes and conversions (a form sent or a newsletter sign-up in the pop-up), counted without
  cookies. A form in a pop-up lands in Enquiries like any other.

Escape and the × button close every pop-up, focus moves into a window and returns afterwards, animations respect
reduced motion, and a pop-up waits until the visitor has dealt with the cookie bar.

## 5. Components

Save a block you use in several places (a service card, a contact strip) as a **component**: select it in the builder and
click the “Save as component” icon in the panel header. Edits in **Appearance → Components** apply everywhere.

Whatever should differ between uses, set as **properties** (e.g. Heading, Link) and insert them into the component with
a `{{heading}}` tag. For each use, fill in the values in the Content panel; an empty field means the default.

## 6. Collections

**Content → Collections** are lists of similar things with their own fields – testimonials, team, products, branches, a price list.

1. Create a collection and its fields (short text, longer text, formatted text, image, link, number, date).
2. Add items.
3. In the builder, insert a **Collection list**. Its inside is the template for one card – put `{{nazev}}` (name),
   `{{url}}` (item page) or your own field tags into texts, images and links. The Content panel shows the available tags.

The list supports **sorting** (also by a field, e.g. price), a **fixed filter**, **filter buttons** for visitors and
**pagination**. When you enable **item pages** for a collection, each item gets an address `/collection/item`; design that
page in the builder via **Detail template**.

On a site with **language versions**, give each item a language. A translated item keeps the same address, e.g.
`/compare/wordpress` and `/de/compare/wordpress`; the language switcher and `hreflang` link the two. Each further
language has its own **Detail template (DE)**. It starts as a copy of the default template, and until you publish it,
items in that language use the default one. The breadcrumbs lead to the translation of the page with the collection's
address (for `/compare`, e.g. `/de/vergleich`).

## 7. Forms and enquiries

The **Form** element (or the *Enquiry form* section) adds an enquiry form. In the Content panel you set the fields (text,
email, phone, list, radio buttons, date, number, consent), button text, thank-you message or thank-you page, a confirmation
to the sender and the notification email. Hidden fields and a submission limit fight spam without CAPTCHA or cookies.
The site can also send each new enquiry to a CRM or Make/Zapier (Settings → Webhooks → New enquiry webhook); conversion
tracking gets a `kaleta:odeslano` event (and a `dataLayer` entry).

**Settings → Webhooks** holds both webhook addresses (a new enquiry, a published news item). The call goes out right after
the page is sent, so a slow receiver never delays a visitor, and every call is signed: the headers `X-Kaleta-Timestamp`
and `X-Kaleta-Signature` (`sha256=` HMAC-SHA256 of `timestamp.body` with the signing secret shown on the tab) let the
receiver check that the call came from your site. The **delivery log** shows every call; a failed one is retried after 1,
5 and 30 minutes and 2 and 12 hours, and a given-up call can be sent again with one click. **Send a test call** checks the
connection. Webhook addresses and the secret are never available over the Claude connection.

Submitted messages are in **Content → Enquiries**: status (new, read, resolved), reply by email, CSV export. When the form is on the
page an ad or a newsletter links to, the enquiry also shows the **campaign** from the address (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`…) –
in the admin, the notification email, the CSV and the webhook, without cookies. Enquiries
contain personal data, so they are deleted automatically after a set number of months (24 by default).

The **Newsletter** extension adds a **Newsletter sign-up** element: visitors enter an e-mail and confirm it by a link
(double opt-in). Confirmed addresses are in **Content → Subscribers**; export them to CSV, including the unsubscribe
link, for your mailing tool.

Or connect the mailing service you already use in **Extensions → Newsletter**: Brevo, MailerLite, Mailchimp, Ecomail,
SmartEmailing, or any other service through a webhook (Make, Zapier, n8n). Enter the API key and the list; every confirmed
subscriber is then added to the list, and an unsubscribed one removed from it. The transfer runs in the background and
failed attempts are repeated; **Subscribers** shows the state of each address and can send all existing ones at once.

**Content → Newsletters** sends your latest news to confirmed subscribers straight from the site. There is no e-mail
builder: one template follows your design system – colours, fonts, corner radius and logo – and holds a subject, a
preview text, an introduction, the latest (or chosen) news items, an optional button and your company details with an
unsubscribe link. Save the draft, check the preview, send a test to yourself, then send now or at a set time (sending
needs the publishing permission). Two things must be set up first, and the screen tells you when they are missing:

- an **SMTP server** in **Settings → Mail** – Brevo, Amazon SES, Mailgun or your own mailbox; bulk mail through the
  hosting's `mail()` would end up in spam. Set **Newsletters: e-mails per hour** to your service's limit;
- **cron** calling the tasks address from **Settings → Health** every few minutes: the e-mails go out in batches on each
  call, so a newsletter never stalls on a quiet site.

Every e-mail carries the subscriber's own unsubscribe link and one-click unsubscribe for mail clients. Nothing tracks
opens; links to your site carry `utm` parameters, so **Statistics** show the visits a newsletter brought. The list of
recipients is kept only while sending – afterwards only the counts and dates remain. Claude can draft newsletters and send
tests too, and sends to subscribers only when you ask.

## 8. Company details

**Settings → Company:** registered name, business type, company ID, VAT ID, address, phone, **opening hours** (one per
line, e.g. “Mo–Fr 8:00–17:00”, “Sa 9–12”, “Su closed”), map link and coordinates. The **Company details** element shows
them anywhere on the site and search engines receive them as structured data – so Google shows your hours and address.
For an **imprint** (legal notice, Impressum) fill in the commercial register entry and who represents the company, then
create a page from the **Imprint** template (Pages → New page) – the Company details element in *Imprint* mode lists all
filled-in details of the operator.

## 9. News, SEO and languages

**News** is the company blog: categories, tags, scheduled publishing, trash, version history. SEO takes care of itself
(sitemap, canonical URLs, structured data, `llms.txt` for AI search). Enable further language versions (`/de/…`) under
**Extensions → Language versions** and pick the languages in Settings – around forty languages, including all EU languages.
Visitor texts (Search, Read more, forms, cookie bar) are translated into Czech, English, German, French, Spanish, Italian,
Polish and Slovak; other languages show them in English, with dates in their own format. The installer lets you choose the
site language separately from the admin language.

System addresses follow the language: Czech versions use `/novinky` and `/hledani`, all others `/news`, `/news/category/…`,
`/news/tag/…` and `/search`. The other form redirects permanently, so old links and search rankings keep working.

**Translating with Claude:** ask Claude to translate a page or the whole site. Over the Claude connection a translation
starts as a copy of the original page's build, so the layout stays the same and only the texts and links change. The
header and footer of a new language start as a copy of the default language's ones.
A language whose home page has no published translation yet is not offered to visitors: it stays out of the language
switcher, `hreflang` and the sitemap until you publish its home page, so you can prepare a translation in peace.

On the first visit, a visitor whose browser prefers one of the site's languages is sent to that version of the page (when it
has a translation); their choice in the language switcher is remembered in the browser, without cookies. Search engine
robots are never redirected. The switcher sits next to the menu by default; to move it to the footer, add the **Language
switcher** element to the footer (a dropdown that opens upwards) and turn off *Language switcher* on the Navigation element.

## 10. AI assistant and Claude

Enable the **assistant** under **Extensions**. Choose a provider (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Mistral), enter
the API key and model. The assistant only suggests. Text goes to the provider only when you click an assistant button.

- In the builder: **✨ Create a section with AI** (describe what it should contain) and **Rewrite with AI** on element text
  (shorter, longer, more formal, friendlier, fix mistakes). Check the result and fill in facts yourself. Ctrl+Z undoes the change.
- In news: headlines, intro, SEO description, tags, proofreading, image descriptions and translation into another site language.

Enable **Claude connection (MCP)** under Extensions. Then:

- **Connector in the Claude app (recommended):** in Settings → Connectors add a custom connector with the address
  `https://your-site.com/mcp`. Claude sends you to the website to sign in and confirm access (OAuth), nothing to copy.
  Connected apps are listed (and can be disconnected) in **My account**. This needs the site on HTTPS in the domain root.
- **Claude Code:** run the command below and confirm access in the browser. Alternatively, create an access token under
  **My account** and add `--header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`.

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http kaleta https://your-site.com/mcp
```

Claude then builds the whole site with your account permissions: it sets the look (colours, fonts, shared classes),
uploads images and fonts to Media, assembles pages, the header, the footer and the item page of collections, fixes single elements by id, sets the site
name, company details and redirects from old addresses, and writes news. It can also create header and footer **variants** for
selected pages, set a page's parent, language version and scheduled publishing, bring back an older published build into the
draft, and read enquiries (only with access to Enquiries). After every build change it gets a **signed
preview link** to the draft (valid for 60 minutes, opens without signing in) – it checks the result and can pass the
link to you. With each save it also gets the **check before publishing** (buttons without links, images without descriptions,
the heading outline) so it can fix them first. Page and site-part builds and news are created as a **draft** and published only when you say so (and only
with publishing permission). The menu, design system, shared classes, site settings, redirects, collection items
and page text take effect straight away – the previous page text goes to the version history. Claude can move a page to
the trash (restorable for 30 days in the admin); the site e-mail, webhooks, mail, backups and security settings cannot
be changed over the connection.

## 11. Moving from WordPress or another Kaleta site

**Administration → Import and export → WordPress:** upload a WordPress export (Tools → Export, an XML file). The import
turns posts into news, pages optionally **straight into the builder**, downloads images into Media and creates redirects
from old addresses. You can run the import again – whatever it already converted is skipped.

**Moving a Kaleta site** to another host or starting a new site from an agency's starter kit: on the old site create
**Import and export → Export of the whole site**, then install Kaleta on the new host and choose **Start from an export**
in the installer. Sign in, open **Import and export → Import from Kaleta** and upload the `.zip` (a larger one over FTP
into `storage/import/`). The preview shows what the export holds; after you confirm, a database backup is made and the
import runs in batches on its own – pages, news, collections, components, shared classes, site parts, menus, pop-ups,
redirects, the media library and its files, the site name, company details, languages and the look. Every row keeps its
number, so all links between pages, menus and components stay valid, and every build goes through the same checks as
a save in the builder. User accounts, passwords, keys, tokens and the mail and backup settings are never in an export,
so the new site keeps its own; imported news belong to you. The import works only on an empty site – a fresh install,
optionally with a starter site.

**One page** travels too: **Pages → Export** downloads a JSON file with the page's build, the shared classes it uses and
its components (including components inside components). **Pages → Import** on another site creates the page hidden,
adds the missing classes (a class the site already has keeps its own look) and the components, and reuses a component
imported before.

## 12. Backups, updates, export

**Settings → Backups and updates:** signed updates and automatic database backups – every day something changed on the
site, otherwise once a week; the last 10 are kept. **Off-site copies** upload each backup to an FTPS server or S3 storage
(Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, Cloudflare R2) and copy the `media/` folder to the same place – only new and changed
files, in the background, so even a large media library gets there bit by bit. The tab shows whether the copy is complete.

To **restore a site after losing the hosting**: install Kaleta on the new hosting with the same table prefix, upload the
latest database backup over FTP into `storage/zalohy/`, copy the `media/` folder back from the FTPS or S3 copy, then click
**Restore** at that backup in Settings → Backups and updates and sign in with the accounts from the backup.

**Import and export → Export of the whole site** creates an open package with the content and media – for moving (see
above) or keeping your content outside Kaleta. Enquiries, subscribers and accounts are not exported.

The **public read-only API** (`/api/novinky`, the *Public API* extension) is deprecated since 1.8 and will be removed in
Kaleta 2.0: its responses carry a `Deprecation` header. Use the JSON Feed (`/feed.json`) or RSS for news, the Claude
connection (MCP) for working with the site, webhooks for events and the site export to take your content out.
