# Set up online bookings

A visitor picks a service, a person (or anyone), a day and a free time. They leave their name, e-mail and phone and get a
confirmation with a calendar link and a cancel link. The site reminds them before the appointment. Kaleta shows prices
only as text; it takes no payments.

## Ground rules

- Start with `site_info`. It tells you the user's role, the extensions that are on, and this connection's access.
  Services, people, settings and booking decisions need full access and an administrator, or the Bookings section for
  the booking list. On a drafts-only connection you can only prepare the page draft and propose exceptions to the
  opening hours.
- Drafts first for the booking page. Publish only when the user explicitly asks.
- Confirming, declining, proposing other times and cancelling e-mail the customer and cannot be taken back. Do them
  only when the user explicitly asks for that booking, and pass `confirm: true`.
- Bookings are personal data. Every read of them is logged; use them only for what the user asks.
- Never ask for passwords, API keys, tokens or other secrets in chat. The site's mail (SMTP) is set by an administrator
  in the Kaleta administration.

## 1. Switch the feature on

Bookings start switched off. If `site_info` does not list the bookings extension and the user wants it, call
`update_settings` with `extensions`. It takes the whole list, so keep every extension that is on now, including
claude, and add bookings. Check `get_health`: customers get e-mails, so mail must work.

## 2. Opening hours

`list_hours` shows the regular week from the company details, the exceptions, and whether the business is open now.

- The regular week is `company_hours` in `update_settings`, one day per line.
- Holidays, closed days and shorter hours go to `save_hours_exception`. Pass `from`, `to` (optional for one day),
  `hours` (empty = closed, or for example 9:00-12:00), a `note`, and `notice_days` for the notice bar.
- A day the site is closed is a day off for everyone.
- On a drafts-only connection an exception is saved as a proposal that a person applies in the administration.
- Delete an exception with `delete_hours_exception` only on the user's explicit request.

## 3. Services

Create each service with `save_booking_service`:

- `name`, `description` (one sentence for the visitor) and `price_text` (shown as written);
- `duration_min` (5–480 minutes; the offered times step by it, up to an hour) and `buffer_min` (time kept free after
  it);
- `requires_confirmation` (true = a booking is a request that waits for the business and holds its time);
- `active` and `sort_order`.

Ask the owner for durations and prices; never guess them.

## 4. People

Create each person who takes bookings with `save_booking_staff`:

- `name`, and `email` for notifications (empty = the site e-mail);
- `services`, the ids of the services they offer (this replaces the list);
- `hours`, their week as `{"monday": "9:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00", …}` (`{}` = the site's opening hours);
- `service_hours` for a service offered at other times than the rest;
- `days_off`, as `[{"from": "2026-12-24", "to": "2026-12-26", "note": "Christmas"}]` (this replaces the list).

The service's `staff` parameter sets the same link from the other side.

## 5. Rules and texts

With `update_settings`:

- `booking_lead_hours`: the earliest booking, in hours ahead.
- `booking_horizon_days`: how far ahead visitors may book.
- `booking_cancel_hours`: until when the customer's cancel link works.
- `booking_reminder_hours`: when the reminder goes out (0 = none).
- `booking_hold_hours`: how long a pending request holds its time.
- `booking_pending_thanks`, `booking_pending_mail` and `booking_declined_mail`: your own texts (empty = the built-in
  ones, `{name}` = the customer's name).

Write the texts in the site's language and tone.

## 6. The booking page

Call `builder_schema` with `elements` `["booking"]` to see the Booking element's fields: the service, the person, the
button text, the thank-you message and the consent text. Read the page with `get_build`, then add the element to its
draft with `edit_build`, using an insert operation. You can also fix the service or the person, with ids from `booking_availability`. Check the page with
`preview_link`. Publish it with `publish_build` only when the user asks.

Check the set-up with `booking_availability` (`service`, `day`, optional `staff`). It returns the free times a visitor
would see. If a day shows nothing, check the hours, the exceptions, the lead time and the horizon.

## 7. Day to day

- `list_bookings`: by day range, person, service and `status` (active, pending, confirmed, declined, done, no_show,
  cancelled, all).
- A pending request waits until the business accepts or declines it. Use `confirm_booking` to accept it, or
  `decline_booking` with an optional personal `message`. `propose_booking_times` offers 1–3 other `times` that
  `booking_availability` shows as free, and the customer picks one.
- `cancel_booking` cancels a booking and e-mails the customer.

All four need the user's explicit request for that booking and `confirm: true`.
