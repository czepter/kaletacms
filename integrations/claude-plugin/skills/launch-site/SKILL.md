# Launch a Kaleta site

The goal is a complete company website, built as drafts, that passes the site audit and that the owner publishes when
they are happy with it.

## Ground rules

- Start with `site_info`. It tells you the user's role, whether they may publish, and this connection's access:
  full, drafts only, or read only. Settings, blueprints and collections need full access and an administrator. On a
  drafts-only connection you build pages, sections and the draft look; tell the user what needs full access.
- The site owner's instructions come with the connection. Follow them. `read_notebook` holds earlier decisions.
- Drafts first. New pages stay hidden, builds stay drafts and the look stays the draft look. Publish only when the user
  explicitly asks.
- Tools that delete, discard, overwrite or send something need the user's explicit confirmation of that exact action.
- Never ask for passwords, API keys, tokens or other secrets in chat. Mail (SMTP), backups, the CAPTCHA secret key and
  code for the page head are set by an administrator in the Kaleta administration.
- Never invent facts: prices, references, certificates, numbers or legal duties. Ask the owner, or leave a visible
  placeholder for them to fill.

## 1. Where the site stands

Call `site_info`, `get_health` and `list_pages`. A fresh install has a home page and a hidden privacy policy page with a
template. `get_health` shows whether mail, cron and backups work. Note what is missing for the hand-over.

## 2. Business details and facts

Ask the owner for the company details and save them with `update_settings`:

- `site_name` and `site_description`;
- `company_name`, `company_street`, `company_city`, `company_postcode` and `company_country`;
- `company_phone`, `company_email` and `company_hours` (one day per line);
- `company_id` and `company_vat_id` where they apply.

The Company details element and the structured data for search engines use them.

Facts that appear in texts (year founded, number of projects, price from…) go to `save_fact`. Pages then use the token
`{{fact.key}}` instead of a number typed into the text. `list_facts` shows the facts already defined.

Call `get_blueprint` to see the industry blueprints (a clinic, a craftsman, a manufacturer…). If one fits and the user
wants it, run `apply_blueprint`. It creates ready-made collections with hidden list pages, and facts without values.
Then ask its questions and save the answers with `save_fact`.

## 3. The look

Set the design system with `update_design_system`. Use a `preset` (firemni, remeslo, pratelsky, elegantni, technologie)
or the owner's brand colours and fonts in `design`; the keys are in `builder_schema`. Upload the logo with `upload_file`
and set it with `update_settings` (`logo`, `favicon`, `share_image`). Show the user `preview_link` with `site: true`.
The look goes live only with `publish_look`, when the user asks.

## 4. Pages

For each page (About, Services, References, Contact…):

1. `create_page` with `title` and a `slug`; it stays hidden.
2. Build it with `build_from_html`, using semantic HTML and one `<style>` block with one-class rules and `var(--ka-…)`
   tokens. Or add ready-made sections with `insert_section`; the library is in `builder_schema`.
3. Fix single elements with `edit_build`, then check `preview_link`. Fix what the check before publishing lists.

Use collections for repeated content (team, services, references, jobs): `list_collection_presets`,
`create_collection`, then `save_collection_items`. New items stay hidden.

## 5. Header, footer and menu

Put a template into the header and the footer with `apply_part_template` (`part` header or footer; the templates are
in `builder_schema`). Adjust them with `edit_build` and `part`. Build the menu with `save_menu` (`location` main or
footer). It goes to the draft look; `get_menu` shows the current one.

## 6. Legal texts as templates

Kaleta generates templates. It never gives legal advice, and neither do you. Say so when you hand a text over.

- **Privacy policy.** The installer created a hidden page with a privacy policy template. Find it with `list_pages`
  and `get_page`. What the site cannot know is in square brackets. Once the features are set, an administrator can
  create a fresh outline that follows them: Pages → New page → Start from a template → Privacy policy. Fill in only
  what the owner tells you, and tell them to check the text against how they really process data and the rules of
  their country.
- **Record of processing.** `processing_record` returns a template assembled from the site's configuration, for the
  owner to review and complete.
- **Imprint.** Where the country needs one, the section library has an imprint section; use `insert_section`.
- **Cookie bar.** `update_settings` with `cookies_mode` (zadna = none, vestavena = built-in, externi = external),
  `cookies_text` and `cookies_policy_url`. Change it only when the user asks. On a cookie policy page, the placeholder
  `{{cookie_table}}` shows the cookies the site really uses.

## 7. Accessibility statement

Run `site_audit` with `kind` accessibility and fix the barriers as drafts: colour contrast in the design system, link
texts, image descriptions. Then call `accessibility_statement`; it returns the statement filled from the audit. The
administrator creates or updates the statement page in Settings → Privacy and cookies, as a hidden draft. The owner
reviews it before publishing.

## 8. Health check before launch

Run `get_health` and `site_audit` (all kinds; the hand-over checks cover mail, backups, company details, indexing, the
site icon and two-step sign-in). Fix what you can as drafts. List what only the administrator can do: SMTP mail,
off-site backups, two-step sign-in, the CAPTCHA keys and analytics codes for the page head.

## 9. Launch

Give the user `list_pending_review` and preview links of the main pages. When they explicitly ask, with full access and
the publishing permission:

1. Run `publish_build` for each page and make it visible with `update_page` (`visible: true`).
2. Run `publish_look` for the look and the menus.
3. Set the home page with `update_settings` (`home_page`).

Write what was decided (tone, sensitive pages, photo credits) into `write_notebook` for the next conversation.
