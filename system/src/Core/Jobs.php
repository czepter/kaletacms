/**
 * Job openings (2.11): what the ready-made Job openings collection (system/presets/jobs.php) needs beyond a collection.
 *
 * The jobs themselves close by their "true until" (Core\Validity) and are described for search engines as JobPosting
 * (Builder\CollectionSchema); the site audit lists a job without a closing date (Core\Audit). This class takes care of the
 * applications: they are enquiries sent from a job's item page, so their source (ka_enquiries.zdroj = collection:<idk>) names a
 * collection made from the jobs preset. That is more robust than the form name – the administrator may rename the form or
 * translate it, a copy of the form on an ordinary page is not an application, and nothing new is stored on the enquiry.
 *
 * Applications carry CVs and are usually kept only for a limited time after the selection, so they have their own retention
 * (the setting job_applications_months, Enquiries → settings; 0 = like other enquiries). The daily clean-up
 * (Core\Notifications::purgePersonalData) deletes them with their attachments and records the count in the change log and
 * as the event applications.purged. The selection is pure and unit-tested.
