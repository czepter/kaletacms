 * Built-in features (the admin screen "Features"; "extensions" in the code and the settings key) – optional parts of the
 * system that the administrator switches on and off.
 *
 * All of them are part of the package and are made in the Kaleta project. Code of other developers comes as add-ons
 * (Extension\Registry, 3.0) – not through this list. A disabled feature disappears from the administration menu and from
 * the site, the data stays.
 *
 * A feature that is new and switched on by default needs a migration that adds it to sites with a saved choice (0016);
 * one that is off by default needs a migration that switches it on where a site already uses it (0073: bookings and
 * whistleblowing, 3.2).
