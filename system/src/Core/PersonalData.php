/**
 * Personal data requests (2.14): someone writes "what do you have about me" or "delete me". The administrator enters the
 * e-mail address once and sees everything the site keeps about it, can give it to the person as a file (the right of
 * access and portability) or erase it (the right to erasure) – instead of searching enquiries, subscribers and queues
 * one by one on each site.
 *
 *  - Found: enquiries with the address as the sender or anywhere in their fields, the subscription and its pending
 *    sync to the mailing service, e-mails still in the outgoing queue, testimonial requests, bookings of appointments
 *    (3.0, Core\Booking), and an account of the administration (shown only – accounts are removed in Users, never here).
 *  - Erasing deletes the enquiries with their attachments, the subscriber with the newsletter queue rows, the pending
 *    e-mails and the testimonial requests; when a mailing service is connected, the address is also removed there
 *    through the usual queue. A published testimonial stays – it is content the person agreed to publish; the result
 *    names it so the administrator can remove it too.
 *  - The change log and the event keep only a masked address and the counts, never the address itself.
 *  - The undo journal of Claude sessions (Core\AgentJournal) does not journal these tables; entries an older release
 *    journaled are redacted on erasure (3.3.2), so undoing a session never brings erased data back.
