/**
 * Kaleta 3.2: feature defaults. Bookings and Whistleblowing became features (Core\Extensions) that new installations
 * start without; an update must never hide what a site uses, so they are switched on here where they are in use:
 *  - Bookings where any booking service or any booking exists;
 *  - Whistleblowing where the channel is open or any case exists.
 * The built-in statistics had two switches (the Statistics feature and the setting "stats"); the feature is now the only
 * one, so a site that had the setting off loses the feature – it never starts measuring by itself.
 *
 * The choice is always written down as a list (a site that never saved one gets the defaults it had until now), so the
 * new defaults of later releases never change it. Safe to run again: it only adds what is in use, and the old statistics
 * setting is reset once its "off" has moved to the feature.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose: the update request of the release before runs this file with its own classes already
 * loaded (a Core\Extensions without the two new keys would drop them), so the keys and their order are written here.
